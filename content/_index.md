Hi, this is my personal blog where i write about my project, nonsense and useless ideas. I love programming because it reminds me when i was a kid, joining lego bricks. In my free time i read generally SciFi, listen to music and play computer games, my other passions.

At the moment i’m studying computer science and trying to improve and develop my skills. I’m available for freelance project so don’t be scared of getting in touch with me.

You can read the things i write in my [blog](/blog) or if you know spanish you can read about my first [baby steps](/taringa) in this world called programming.

Or you can take a peek in the [list of books](/books) i want to read forward.
