Taking exams can be very stressful. So what better way to relax than looking through pictures of smiling dogs?. This is it, a little website to scroll pictures of [r/PuppySmiles](https://old.reddit.com/r/PuppySmiles/).

You can [use it](https://pudymody.github.io/puppies/) (It doesnt work on firefox if you have tracking protection enabled. But you can always disable it just for this site. I wont collect anything from you, everything runs client-side. But i cant garantee anything from Reddit)

If you wanna look at the [source code](https://github.com/pudymody/puppies) is on Github, and is made with Vue.
