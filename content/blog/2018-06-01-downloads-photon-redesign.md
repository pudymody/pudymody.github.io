> I was a firefox user for a long time, but then i had to switch to another browser because it was slow and unnusable. Since the Quantum era im a happy firefox user again. Everything is fast as hell and the Photon ui its awesome, everything its unified, except for a forgotten place, the library view. Although we have a new fancy viewer, when you want to see all the downloads you still have something that seems out of place with respect all the UI. So i made this proof of concept to show how a Photonish download library could be.
