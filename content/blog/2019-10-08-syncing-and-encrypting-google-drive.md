For a long time i have been looking for a way to sync and backup my files to Google Cloud, but they have to be encrypted before. ~~Yes i dont like google~~. My first attempt was to use something like [Veracrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html), but it only generates a gigantic blob with all your files in it, nothing good to make diff sync. Then i found [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/), it seems the perfect solution as it encrypt files individually, but i have already files around two different disks, and using it i will have to reorganize them. Also i still had to download the official Drive app. Finally i found the perfect solution, [Rclone](https://rclone.org/). Its a cli app, which let me run commands like copy or move to individual files or folders, and it will upload them to a lot of different cloud or local providers. One of its local providers, its one which will encrypt files. **It also does it on memory, so you dont waste extra space on the hdd, and having some space constrains its wonderful.** In the cloud providers, drive its available. This is the perfect tool, it works as a drive client, it encrypts on the fly, and its open source. What else could i ask for?. The setup is also straightforward, you download it, [follow the drive setup](https://rclone.org/drive/), next you [follow the crypt setup](https://rclone.org/crypt/) and its done. Now when you want to copy a file, you only need to run ```rclone -P localfile secret:drivepath```. Beautiful and simple, as everything should be.
