> Seeing that more people also wants a better profile manager, and being locked in, i decided to make a POC for one. This currently only works with firefox nightly with the extensions.experiments.enabled flag enabled. More info on how to install it in the repository.

> An extension experiment to make an easier local profile switcher from the main ui similar to what is found in other browsers. As this only works to ease the switching of local profiles, they are still managed at about:profiles. As a first POC ( Proof of concept ) this still doesnt answer some questions like Should Firefox accounts considered a separate profile? or even How this integrate with Firefox accounts?.
