> This is a firefox extension to get a QR code of the current url. Almost the same as the [url to qr code
](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/url-to-qrcode/) extension for Firefox, but i like the idea of [this issue](https://github.com/smoqadam/url-to-qrcode-firefox-addon/issues/13) and seems a good side project.

The same functionality you get from [Chrome's share QR](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9979877) but as Firefox Extension.

You can get it from the [Mozilla Addon page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/qr-code-address-bar/). Or if you like, you could read the [source code](https://github.com/pudymody/firefox-qr).
