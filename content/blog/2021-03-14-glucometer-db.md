Hello, yesterday i was thinking about my first glucose meter and after searching for hours on the internet i couldnt find any info about it. So i dug up my old boxes and took some pictures.

After that, i began to search and think, why isnt there any kind of wiki/database of glucose meters? As i couldnt find anyone, i decide to make one with the few meters i have accumulated along the years, and the ones i could find in the mainstream vendors.

Why this? Just to spare some time, and who knows, maybe someone finds useful a website with all the meters and its manuals.

This is where i need your help. I would like information and pictures to put from other meters you are using, or that you have. It doesnt matter if its an old one, on the contrary, i would really like to see old ones. Thats what started this. For example, i found out that the performance im using, is an old version, and that there is a new one.

If you know how to code, you could contribute directly in the [repository](https://github.com/pudymody/glucometer-db), and if you dont, dont worry, just comment them here, or send them by PM, and i will add them.

Anyway, if you want to see what i currently have, you can visit the page: [https://pudymody.github.io/glucometer-db/](https://pudymody.github.io/glucometer-db/)

And here some picture of my first meter, has anyone used it, or knows it? Some are mine, and others i found them on the web.
