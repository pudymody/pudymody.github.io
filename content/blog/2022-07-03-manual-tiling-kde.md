title: Manual tiling for KDE.

I always liked the idea behind [Divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/). I like tiling, but i usually dont have more than 3 or 4 windows open at the same time. Most of the time they are one maximized, or two with half the screen each. But sometimes i need to place 3 or 4 in some way, and i think having a tiling window manager just for this rare cases its a little overkill.

Today instead of studying for my exams, i decided to make a Kwin script to simulate the divvy way of manual tiling.

All the instructions of how to install and use it are in the [Github repository](https://github.com/pudymody/kde-manualtiling).
But nothing strange, download the kwinscript file and install it from settings. Hit the shortcut, click here, there, hit the shortcut again to hide it and you are done.
