Maybe you are faster highlighting with a rectangle selection instead of a text one. Maybe your pdf doesnt have text information or is an image. Or you want to highlight parts of an image inside your document. I dont care why, but this is how you do it.

I think this is a clear example of the motto of Plasma **Simple by default, Powerful when needed**.

Also..., why are you reading this in a post with big images and a clear title?.

Open your Okular settings by clicking on *Settings -> Configure Okular...* and go to the *Annotations* section

![Annotations section](/static/imgs/highlight-rectangle-okular/1.png)

There click on *Add* and create a new one with the following settings:

- Type: Geometrical Shape
- Type: Rectangle
- Color: Pure yellow
- Opacity: 40% (this is what i like, not too bright, not too transparent)
- Shape fill: Checked
- Width: 0

After closing and opening Okular again, you can use your new rectangle highlighter from the toolbar itself.
