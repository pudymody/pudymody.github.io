Yes, i know this is something intrinsic to how RSS works, but i've never thought about it until yesterday. I was reading an article in my reader app, and i couldnt load an embeded youtube video. I thought it was something about the app or the video failing, so i opened it in my browser and i discovered that i didnt have an internet connection. It was down for a few days. *But i was still able to read the full article and a few more*.

**Provide the full article in your feed, you never know when people will be able to read it**
