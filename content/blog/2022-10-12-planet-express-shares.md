Yesterday i was seeing the episode "Future Stock" of Futurama (S03E21 or #53) and in the middle i thought *"there is enough information scattered around the chapter to know how many stocks everyone has"*.

So lets do that.

![Scene where Amy,Leela, Bender,Hermes and Professor votes](/static/imgs/planet-express-shares/00.jpg)
In this scene, we can see that between Amy, Leela, Bender, Hermes and the Professor, they have 50.000. I will assume that as they are 5 people, everyone has the same amount. We can also see that Fry has 10.000. So its not insane to think that everyone has 10.000

![Scruffy voting 40.000](/static/imgs/planet-express-shares/01.jpg)
Here we can see that Scruffy has 40.000 and quoting Leela *"40,000? How come you have four-times as much stock as the rest of us?"* we confirm that everyone has 10.000

![Hattie voting 1](/static/imgs/planet-express-shares/02.jpg)
In this one, Hattie (yes, i had to google her name) uses her only share to uneven a draw between *Professor Farnsworth* and *That Guy*

And here we finally learn that Zoidberg had the 51% of the shares, which he sold to That Guy for a sandwich.

After That Guy's death, all his shares belongs to Fry being the vicepresident.

So.... With everything in place, here is how much everyone has.

- Amy: 10.000
- Leela: 10.000
- Bender: 10.000
- Hermes: 10.000
- Professor: 10.000
- Scruffy: 40.000
- Hattie: 1
- Zoidberg: 0
- Fry: 104.083 (Zoidberg -> That Guy -> Fry) + 10.000 = 114.083

We can confirm this is correct looking in [The Infosphere](https://theinfosphere.org/Planet_Express#Shares), because yes, someone has already done this piece of trivia before.
