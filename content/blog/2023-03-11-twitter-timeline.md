Today i was victim of the twitter timeline. Its the first time because i tried to heavily curate my feed. I only follow people that i like what they post and that bring me joy. I have various list that are sorted by time, instead of the main timeline. But from time to time, i read the main just to doomscroll through it.

Today i saw this tweet and i thought *"i dont remember following him."* It must be that someone i follow commented it.

Nop, not the case.

I dont follow him, but some accounts that i do, does. But im not mad against twitter recommending it, **im mad that its not clear why im seeing this tweet and that it has no clear indication that this is a tweet from someone that i dont follow.** It was presented to me like any other tweet from the people i **DO** follow.

I think its time to step up my RSS game, start clearing my list to improve the content/noise ratio and migrate to some kind of selfhosted reader to allow me reading from everywhere.
