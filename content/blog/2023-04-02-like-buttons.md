> I think of likes on social media kind of like non-verbal responses in the real world. When I say something clever and someone around me smiles, they don't have to think of something thoughtful to say as a response, I know they liked what I said, and that makes me happy.

This is a quote from [Chris Hannah](https://chrishannah.me/) from [Like Buttons](https://chrishannah.me/like-buttons/) which in itself its a quote from [I'm Once Again Defending Like Buttons](https://birchtree.me/blog/im-once-again-defneding-like-buttons/) by [Birchtree](https://birchtree.me/)

It reminded me of [this commit](https://github.com/pudymody/pudymody.github.io/commit/5ea64332bd25ce271c13884900e311d2030a92f8) i made a few years back where i thought something similar.

> My twitter polling mechanism has failed a few times this last week and i
started thinking how useful and how much content they provide. None.
This was my conclusion. They only appear as a log of actions i have
made, they dont provide any useful or new content. They feel like a
robotic dump of things, it doesnt feel human. Also likes doesnt always
means a like, sometimes is something else that you cant understand
without the context. Thats why im removing them and sticking only with
tweets and retweets.
Also searching on the web, i found this article that express somewhat
what i think.

Maybe likes arent that bad, but the bullshit algorithms and metrics around them.
