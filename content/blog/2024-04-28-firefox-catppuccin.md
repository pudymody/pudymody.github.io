Im finally ricing my linux setup (you can view [my custom DWM build](https://github.com/pudymody/dwm) but beware as there isnt any documentation for the changes that i made other than the commits), and i want Firefox to follow my current Catppuccin theme. The problem is that i also have a switcher between light and dark mode, or sometimes i want to change the highlight color. The [Firefox colors](https://github.com/catppuccin/firefox) version doesnt allow this, so i wrote this extension. You could install it from the [Firefox addons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/catppuccin-selector/).

Combine it with the different [userstyles](https://github.com/catppuccin/userstyles) available and you could get the full experience.
