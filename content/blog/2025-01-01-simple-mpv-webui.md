This is a shoutout to [simple-mpv-webui](https://github.com/open-dynaMIX/simple-mpv-webui).

I was looking for some way to remote control [MPV](https://mpv.io/) from my phone but everything were apps with lots of dependencies or environments needs to run. Plus an android app.

To my luck, simple-mpv-webui runs as a mpv script serving a web frontend.

The only dependencie was [lua52-luasocket](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/lua52-luasocket)

Now i can binge watch from the bed and control everything.
