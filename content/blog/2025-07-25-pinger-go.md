In the last months/year i've been using [statping-ng](https://github.com/statping-ng/statping-ng) to have an overview of my site's health. But there is a thing that annoys me a lot. Whenever a site is down, you wont see it in the graph, you would only see the drop in the uptime percentage or the color of the graph if its happening at the moment.

Then i tried [uptime-kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) but running it under some subpath can be quite tricky.

I only want one thing, multiple jobs/crons querying a webpage, reporting how long it took, if it was ok or not and then do some graph per day to have an overview. So what did i do? What every programmer do, write my own. Thats how [pinger-go](https://github.com/pudymody/pinger-go) was born. There are a [few issues](https://github.com/pudymody/pinger-go/issues) yet, but for my usecase for now its ok. Maybe in the future when i need them i will look at them.

Want to try it? Just run

```podman run -e "BASE_PATH=/pinger/" -e "TZ=America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires" -e "HTTP_ADDR=:8080" -v pinger_data:/data ghcr.io/pudymody/pinger-go:main```

And visit `/pinger/endpoint/` to add your own.
