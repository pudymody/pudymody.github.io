Surfing the web i found three piece of software from my early days using a computer. They are:

Genecyst, the first ever emulator i have ever used. It came to me in a cd full of sega roms. Back in the days when internet wasnt a common thing.

Normy's beach babe-o-rama, one of those thousands of roms in the cd. I used to love this game.

Crystal caves, one of the first games i have downloaded when i could access the internet.
