> It kind of reminds me of [this blog post](https://rachsmith.com/learning-in-public-is-complicated/) that Rach Smith wrote, about how learning in public is challenging when you’re very deep in layers of niche engineering. It’s hard for me to lay out, for example, a specific type of strategy I learned in the game go, because so few people I know actually play it. It’s hard for me to explain the details around keycap designs I’ve worked out, because so few people understand how much effort that takes or why it’s exciting. It’s hard for me to describe some of the little (and big) problems I’ve solved, because y’all simply don’t have the context I have to understand why it’s thrilling that it’s finally done.

> Take one of my work days recently. I was struggling with something and thought writing a note about it might help. The problem was that the “something” was generating [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) types from [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) files using [GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) in a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project using a custom [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) config, that lives in a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) powered by [Lerna](http://www.lerna.com.au/). There were …seven tools or technologies in that sentence. My potential note is niched down so hard, it feels like there is maybe one other person in the world who can relate. His name is Geoff and chances are he’s not reading this site.
