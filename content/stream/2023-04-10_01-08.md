> Instead - I think most people would be better served by subscribing to small b blogging. What you want is something with YOUR personality. Writing and ideas that are *addressable* (i.e. you can find and link to them easily in the future) and *archived* (i.e. you have a list of things you’ve written all in one place rather than spread across publications and URLs) and *memorable* (i.e. has your own design, logo or style). Writing that can live and breathe in small networks. Scale be damned. When you write for someone else’s publication your writing becomes disparate and UN-networked. By chasing scale and pageviews you lose identity and the ability to create meaningful, memorable connections within the network.

> Forget about “visibility” for your post. The unit of blogging isn’t pageviews, it’s conversations.
