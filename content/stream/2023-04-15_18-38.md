> Experiments like Arc feel like they could have more in common with [tools-for-thought](https://maggieappleton.com/tools-for-thought) software like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/). Those tools build knowledge graphs of connected nodes. A kind of hypertext of ideas. But we’ve already got hypertext tools we use every day: web browsers. It’s just that they don’t do much with the accumulated knowledge of our web browsing. Our browsing history is a boring reverse chronological list instead of a cool-looking knowledge graph or timeline.
