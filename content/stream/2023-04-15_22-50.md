> Why write an essay when you can type a few words and have AI generate one for you? Why write an email when AI can auto-respond for you with all the typical pleasantries and talking-points? While AI doing these things for you is likely to happen, itâ€™s not necessarily a good thing. Even when these tools exist, they are not a replacement for writing. Writing is the process by which you realize that you do not understand what you are talking about. Importantly, writing is also the process by which you figure it out.

From [AI: Do we really "get it"?](https://www.antonsten.com/ai/) by [Anton Sten](https://www.antonsten.com/) but is quoted from [Why Write?](https://fs.blog/why-write/)
