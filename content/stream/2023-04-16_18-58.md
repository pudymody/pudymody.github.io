> The simple power of a URL is that anyone can click it and instantly access it. All you need is a browser. There is no need to install an application or worry about what operating system you are running on.

A quote from Thomas Nattestad in [Photoshop's journey to the web](https://web.dev/ps-on-the-web)

> Web applications are inherently universal. They run on whatever operating system is capable of running a Web browser and they do not need to be compiled for each operating system separately. The same code base powers the application on all platforms. This does not mean that there are no compatibility issues—there are plenty actually—but there is a [solid, shared, increasing baseline](https://web.dev/interop-2022/) that all applications can build upon.

> Investing in a memorable domain name can sometimes actually be better for discoverability. Even for app stores, people still rely most on recommendations from friends and family members to discover new apps according to [research done by Google](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/_qs/documents/331/how-users-discover-use-apps-google-research.pdf).

> The tooling and framework situation in the Web development world is infamous for being confusing and hard to keep up with. In practice, though, companies would use one technology and tooling stack and stay true to it for many years. The world of tech Twitter is one thing, the reality in businesses, where the decades-old jQuery is still (and by a large amount) the [most popular framework](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2021/javascript#libraries-and-frameworks), is the other.

> Web applications have seen impressive performance improvements thanks to advanced technologies such as [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (including [SIMD](https://v8.dev/features/simd)), [WebGPU](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/), and general JavaScript engine progress in recent years. Nonetheless, a carefully developed, platform-specific app will typically outperform a Web-based application (albeit the situations where this _actually_ matters may be limited). With even high-performance audio-editing tools like [Soundtrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/) (thanks to the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and [AudioWorklet](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/AudioWorklet)), interactive development environments like [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try), and graphics-editing tools like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (thanks to WebAssembly), and of course graphics-intensive games like [Quake](http://www.quakejs.com) (thanks to [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) and [WebGPU](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/) in the future), the boundaries are being pushed at a rapid rate.
