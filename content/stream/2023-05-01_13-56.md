> We obsessively optimise when it comes to scripts, styles, and other resources; interestingly, that doesn't always apply to HTML. In the case of single-page apps, it may feel like you stand to gain more in performance if you focus on JavaScript. In the case of server-rendered, non-interactive sites, [some people doubt](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2021/thoughts-on-avoiding-an-excessive-dom-size/) that the performance impact of a large DOM is noticeable.

> We also lack the required tooling: according to Jens Meiert, not enough HTML minifiers [prune optional HTML tags and default attributes](https://meiert.com/en/blog/html-performance/). When it comes specifically to unneeded wrapper elements, tooling wouldn't help us anyway (you would need a pretty sophisticated analysis of the associated styling to determine if an element can really be omitted).

> Finally, working with deeply nested DOM trees just slows you down. [...] Debugging becomes harder, tracking down nodes in the inspector becomes more tedious, and the joy of the craft is diminished.

> If we can use our design systems to speed up meaningful work, standardise things to a high quality, and scale the things we actually want to reproduce — then the reverse is also true. It means that we can also use our design systems to speed up problematic work, standardise things to a poor quality, and scale things we don't want to reproduce.
