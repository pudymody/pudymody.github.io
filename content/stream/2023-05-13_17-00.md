I was browsing Hacker News just now, and I came across an interesting question asked by user [l2silver](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=l2silver):

> \[What is the\] most interesting tech you built for just yourself? - [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35729232)

It's an interesting question, and I'm sure a lot of tech people could some up with something interesting. But probably none as delightful as [this answer](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35738249) from [sriram\_malhar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sriram_malhar):

> My MIL is 93, and the only tech she can really deal with is turning on the radio and TV and changing channels.  
>   
> She is fond of music from old classics (from the 60's and earlier), so I hooked up a Raspberry PI with an FM transmitter and created her own private radio station. She tells me what songs she likes and I create different playlists that get broadcast on her station. It preserves the surprise element of radio, and there is nothing in there she doesn't like.  
>   
> The tiny FM transmitter is surprisingly powerful. Her neighbours (of similar vintage) are very happy too, so their requests have also started coming in :)

Now, *that's* personal tech. My favourite part of it is that it still preserves the feeling and spontaneity of listening to radio. Perfect solution, and requires no extra learning at all!
