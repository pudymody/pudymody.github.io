> In its README, it said that if I wanted to opt-out of having this particular tool scrape my images, I had to [add some non-standard headers to my site](https://www.deviantart.com/team/journal/A-New-Directive-for-Opting-Out-of-AI-Datasets-934500371). There was no way to opt-_in_ to the bot.

> It seems that every few years we have to have the same argument. Someone releases a tool on the Internet and claims that, if you don't want to participate, you must explicitly opt-out.

> It isn't hard to see why that's an obnoxious idea. Thousands of tools are released every day. Am I expected to play whack-a-mole and shut down every new one that appears? That is a perverse way to expect people to behave. These bots cost people time and money without offering any tangible benefit.

> By analogy, I can't suddenly declare that everyone online has to pay me Â£5 - oh, you don't want to? Sorry, you should have opted-out last month. That'll be a fiver, please.

> Me asking for a tool to respect the consent of users is, apparently, an ethical crime against people who _might_ benefit from whatever the tool _could_ create in the future. That's some "[For The Greater Good](https://youtu.be/rm--inJtnc4?t=111)" shit!

> Different cultures have different ethics and one of the problems with the Internet is that we occasionally butt up against different norms of behaviour. But I think, in all cultures, you can't just start grabbing a person's stuff and then say "but you didn't _explicitly_ say that I couldn't! Besides, it's for your own good!!"
