> Google is a portal to the web. Google is an amazing tool for finding relevant websites to go to. That was useful when it was made, and it’s nothing but grown in usefulness. Google should be encouraging and fighting for the open web. But now they’re like, _actually we’re just going to suck up your website, put it in a blender with all other websites, and spit out word smoothies for people **instead** of sending them to your website._ Instead.

> And while doing that, they aren’t:
> - Telling authors their content is being used to train
> - Telling users where the output came from
> - Offering any meter of how reliable or confidently correct the output is

> So, I’m critical. It’s irresponsible.
