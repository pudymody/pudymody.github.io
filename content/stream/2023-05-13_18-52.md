> In a world awash with software whose shelf life approximates that of my grocery store milk, I love that [there is no semver to worry about on the web](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2021/canistilluse.com/) — HTML5, CSS3, ES6, these are not major breaking changes.

> However, as Chris points out, all of those features are a accretion to the language. “Don’t break the web” means we don’t have to worry about reading CSS release notes like, “🚨 Breaking changes: `float` has been replaced by `flex`. You must upgrade to newest version.”

> But how long can we reasonably go without _removing_ the old? How viable is this approach over time? 100 years from now, will people still be able to write `float` in their CSS?

> I don’t know how the web will evolve over time to deal with what — I assume? — will inevitably become a problem of incomprehensible complexity resulting from decades of language accretion (like [stalagmites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalagmite) in a cave).
