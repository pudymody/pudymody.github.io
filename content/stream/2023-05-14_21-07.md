> A person being able to modify an experience so it suits their specific needs is one of the web platform’s greatest strengths. You shouldn’t attempt to block, subvert, or otherwise undermine someone’s ability to do so.

> Test actual support with different operating systems and modes other than the ones you use on a daily basis. Remember that the way you use technology is not the default, and that the majority experience is a contradiction in terms.

> You don’t get to pick who visits your website or web app, what their circumstances are, or how they choose to interact with your content. Choosing not to mess with the browser’s scrollbar is a simple, yet powerful thing you can do to help ensure people can get what they need.
