> The more you leverage a compilation process, the more you start writing code for the compiler that has no chance of portability and that I feel has problems down the road. Think of how no one at the company wants to touch the Webpack config for fear of it all falling down. Every shortcut is a potential pain point in a refactor down the road.

> Regardless of how convenient something is to add into my build process, I still want to abide in the Rule of Least Power as a programming principle. My ideal coding environment is to have zero build processes. Those who build with Web Components have tasted this buildless future.

>  My ideal “compiler” right now might be something that generates an import map and injects it into my pages then touches nothing else except possibly minifying (without uglification).

> Anyways, my criticisms aren’t about Svelte or Vue and probably more general about compilers themselves. I’m tired of them. I’ve built a lot of code modification pipelines over the years and you know what always breaks down? The code modification pipelines.
