> once you start turning these off, you realize that most notifications are actually just avenues for companies trying to boost your engagement with their apps. like those reddit notifications you get about random people posting? totally for engagement. do you actually need to hear from them? no! turn them off. give me my autonomy: i’d rather pull than be pushed.

> often people reaching out to me can really take me away from my present or ruin my focus. imagine you’re having dinner with someone but you keep reading messages from other people or messaging them — isn’t that really sad? you literally have someone of infinite depth right in front of you! talk to them!

> but also, there are some notifications that are really mentally heavy, and could completely ruin your day. i’ve definitely gotten some of these messages. if possible, i’d like to handle these things when i’m not working or having a good time with friends, since it’ll just change my reality. you know, there used to be times when people weren’t reachable 24/7.
