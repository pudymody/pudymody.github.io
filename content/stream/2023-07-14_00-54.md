> Look at almost any job posting for front-end development and you’ll see that CSS still isn’t valued as its own skill. Never mind that you could specialise in a _subset_ of CSS—layout, animation, architecture—and provide 10× value to an organisation, the recruiters are going to play it safe and ask you if you know React.

> [Rachel Nabors](http://rachelnabors.com/) and I were chatting about this gap between the real and perceived value of modern CSS. She astutely pointed out that CSS is kind of a victim of its own resilience. The way you wrote CSS ten years ago still works, and will continue to work. That’s by design. Yes, you can write [much better, more resilient CSS](https://moderncss.dev/modern-css-for-dynamic-component-based-architecture/) today, but if those qualities aren’t valued by an organisation, then you’re casting your pearls before swine.

> That said, it’s also true that the JavaScript you wrote ten years ago also continues to work today and will continue to work in the future. So why is it that devs seem downright eager to try the latest JavaScript hotness but are reluctant to use CSS that’s been stable for years?

> Or perhaps that’s not an accurate representation of the JavaScript ecosystem. It may well be that the eagerness only extends to libraries and frameworks. There’s reluctance to embrace native JavaScript APIs like [`Proxy` or web components](https://adactio.com/links/20192). There’s a weird [lack of trust](https://adactio.com/journal/19021) in web standards, and [an underserved faith](https://adactio.com/journal/19029) in third-party libraries.

> She compared the number of “front-end” conferences dedicated to JavaScript—[over 50 listed on one website](https://dev.events/)—to the number of conferences dedicated to CSS. There’s just one. CSS Day.
