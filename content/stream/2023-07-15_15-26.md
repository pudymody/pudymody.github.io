> Google has sunk its teeth into our daily lives with Gmail and Google Calendar and YouTube and Drive (and more), and they’ve made these tools (amongst others, Google Domains included) really convenient. They all just work together, and their APIs are solid enough that third party developers can build off of them relatively easily. And because they own the APIs as a centralized system, developers are at the whim of whatever they decide to change. They can monetize it however they want, and control how content is served to an extent.

> When you contribute to the standard in addition to your own software, you’re benefitting everyone, which is ultimately good for your business.
