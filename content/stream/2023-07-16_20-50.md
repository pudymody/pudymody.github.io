Reading [Animated Pride Flags](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/pride-flags/) (a beautiful and wonderful post as everything that he does) by [Josh W. Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/), i found about [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/) and this **EXCELLENT** feature.

Press ESC three times and leave the site, even replacing the current history entry.

Although is extremly awful and sad that this kind of features have to exists in our world
