Reading [Whose Cert Is It Anyway?](https://www.netmeister.org/blog/caa-diversity.html) by [Jan Schaumann](https://www.netmeister.org/index.html) i found the following bug reports that are hilarous, along some of its comments. [Add Honest Achmed's root certificate](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=647959), [Add my root CA cert to mozilla's trusted root CA cert list](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=233458), [Security concerns with the e-Tugra certificate authority](https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/yqALPG5PC4s/m/iTVd3HNwAwAJ)

> Resolved invalid? What's the difference between Honest Achmed and the other CAs? Just an audit report? The community should chip in!

> Considering the problems at DigiNotar I vote for giving Honest Achmed a second chance!

> The reality is that nobody really cares, nothing that bad has happened (at least in the western world, ignoring the spyware and dead journalists, and repression in various countries). I have a briefing on this and it boils down to "if you want to be especially paranoid do what VISA does ([https://developer.visa.com/pages/trusted\_certifying\_authorities](https://developer.visa.com/pages/trusted_certifying_authorities)), there's no point in trying to prevent bad CAs from getting in or staying in".

And finally, a quote from the article itself

> If you're wondering whether you really need to have over 160 different CAs in your trust bundle, I suspect the answer is "no"; you could likely get away with fewer than 20 and wouldn't notice the difference. But whether that's a good thing, whether it's wise for the entire internet to place all -- well, >99% -- of its certificates/eggs into fewer than 10 CAs/baskets seems more than questionable.

It seems that we arent living the decentraliced dream that we believe, and the security of all the internet is at hands of a few companies.
