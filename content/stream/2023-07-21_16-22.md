[Cyclic Dependency Space Toggles](https://kizu.dev/cyclic-toggles/) by [Roman Komarov](https://kizu.dev/) is another great example of how CSS is more complex and powerful that you may think. That custom properties are more than *simple variables for theming*. Something that [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/) already told us in the past with her post [The --var: ; hack to toggle multiple values with one custom property](https://lea.verou.me/blog/2020/10/the-var-space-hack-to-toggle-multiple-values-with-one-custom-property/) and her talk [CSS Variable Secrets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuZizqDF4q8)
