> More and more devices that we use every day that were once dumb machines now come with embedded computers and software that is often set to update automatically over the Internet. Televisions, toasters, refrigerators, automobiles, ovens, DVR's--even speakers, light bulbs, and toothbrushes. Seemingly, whatever a manufacturer can possibly stuff a computer into is now fair game. And we are told that we must update our software constantly, because ransomware gangs and other criminals are prowling every IP address on the Internet looking for vulnerable devices to pry their way into.

> One may point to multiple examples in which bad software updates have led to great inconvenience for their owners. One was highlighted by [Apple's 113 million court settlement](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/936268845/apple-agrees-to-pay-113-million-to-settle-batterygate-case-over-iphone-slowdowns) in 2020 over iOS updates that slowed the operation the iPhone 7 and 6S. In fact, the slowdown was so severe that some customers felt the need to buy new iPhones. Another event occurred in 2019 when a [Chinese NIO electric automobile](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18205774/nio-ota-update-traffic-china-es8) stopped in traffic and imprisoned its occupant for over an hour after it was disabled by an over-the-air software update. At least one [Lucid Air EV](https://www.teslarati.com/lucid-air-bricked-after-failed-ota-update) was also disabled the same way in 2022. Windows users are very familiar with reports over the years of certain [Windows updates breaking users' computers](https://www.laptopmag.com/news/windows-10-update-now-bricking-pcs-what-to-do). And finally, a recent automatic update of firmware that was designed to prevent the use of third-party ink "[rendered some models of HP OfficeJet printers useless for weeks](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/hp-breaks-its-own-printers-again-with-firmware-update/2/)". Customers were forced to [mail their printers back to HP for repairs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/hp-rushes-to-fix-bricked-printers-after-faulty-firmware-update).
