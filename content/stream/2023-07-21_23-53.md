> When you think about building fluid layouts these days isn’t about having fixed-width breakpoints anymore. Instead, the layouts we build today need to work on nearly any device size. 

> I talk with clients and designers who think responsive design is simply having a web page designed with two versions: one for desktop, and the other for mobile. This is considered an old, outdated way of dealing with the web nowadays.

> First things first, right? For me, I consider that the web is responsive by default. When you think about it, adding a bunch of HTML elements without any CSS, works on any screen size.

> It’s responsive by default until we decide to move things next to each other. [...] So, the web is responsive by default, unless we start getting creative in designing our layouts.
