> Documentation is one of those things that you don’t appreciate until you have to work without it—trying to make sense of a code base, library, or API without documentation can be a very stressful and overwhelming experience, and it can cause all sorts of problems for your team.

> Nobody can point out shortcomings on your team quite as well as new hires can.

> Good documentation not only helps your seasoned developers to navigate unfamiliar areas of the product and amass more domain knowledge, but it also helps newcomers to get up and running more quickly and familiarize themselves with your team.

> In practice, good documentation should go beyond the code itself and also cover your team, the product, your work process, areas of specialization, and many other important details.

> The bigger and more complex your product, the more likely it is to consist of many moving pieces that work together. Senior developers on your team probably have intimate knowledge of this data flow, but other developers may only specialize in one or two areas, and newer developers will need to spend time working with the product before they understand how all or even some of the pieces relate to one another.

> Navigating a new code base on a new team at a new company without documentation is like hiking in the middle of nowhere without a map or compass: Eventually, you’re going to lose your way. Documentation—especially the right kind of documentation—can make a world of difference for your team
