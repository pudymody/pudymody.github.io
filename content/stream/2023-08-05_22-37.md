> Here's what I'll do today and it would be great if you would join me. On the website you're working on today, find a stylesheet and add the following rule. ``` *, *:hover { cursor: none !important; } ``` That forces you to use the keyboard. If you find something that makes it hard or impossible to do using the keyboard, fix it! Not just for yourself but for everyone relying on keyboard accessibility. Edit: fixed code formatting
