> Procrastination is the state of waiting for motivation to come. Paradoxically, the most reliable way to create motivation is to start doing the thing.

> Actions precede feelings. If you want to feel a certain way, create the environment that allows you to nibble your way there. Donâ€™t hope that inspiration will come. Take a small bite. Action precedes inspiration, not the other way around.
