> One of the most fascinating things I took away from so many of our sessions was how little people cared about our software — especially the user interface.

> All they ever wanted was to get a job done, and our interface was nothing more than a delivery mechanism for the thing they actually wanted.

> In fact, customers would often specifically mention how little they cared for the “usability” of our software. They vowed they’d go through the most tedious workflows imaginable if they could ultimately get the primary thing they wanted from us, which was not software.
