> For the most part, I think the RSS reader apps that we have now are actually much nicer than Google Reader ever was. So my nostalgia is very tempered. But the social features of Google Reader, I donâ€™t think, have quite been replicated yet.

I think this is the final thing missing in the RSS world. The parts are there, you can already share your starred articles, and blog with comments in a section of yours. The only thing missing is a user experience that makes this easy for everyone.
