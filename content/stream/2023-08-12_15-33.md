> I really like this article from Rohan D "[Every Phone Should Be Able to Run Personal Website](https://rohanrd.xyz/posts/every-phone-should-be-able-to-run-personal-website/)".

> In it, they make the convincing case that phones are perfectly capable of hosting websites and - if we want more people to escape the walled-gardens - this could be a good way to get people back into self-hosting.

I LOVE this idea of truly personal and selfowned websites. Although pretty hard to do in real life.
