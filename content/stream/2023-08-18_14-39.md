> Good software seamlessly integrates itself into users' lives, enhancing their capabilities and experiences without necessitating significant conscious effort on their part. In that sense, software is indeed a vehicle, its design and functionality facilitating the journey of its users from one point of need or desire to another.

> Becoming lost in these tools can lead to a kind of tunnel vision, where the focus is placed more on how to leverage the latest technology than on the value that the software is intended to deliver. As a result, software projects can risk becoming technologically impressive but functionally lacking or unnecessarily complex. It is akin to constructing a sleek and state-of-the-art vehicle that, for all its advanced features, does not transport passengers comfortably or safely.
