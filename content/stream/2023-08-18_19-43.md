> *"Stick to boring architecture for as long as possible, and spend the majority of your time, and resources, building something your customers are willing to pay for." - Kelsey Hightower*

> As engineers, we are, by nature, attracted to novel solutions. However, it’s critical to discern between what’s exciting and what’s right for your use case. Often, “boring” technology – those stable, well-understood, and perhaps previous-generation tools – have a lot to offer. They are usually tried and tested, have proven scalability, and come with extensive documentation and community support.

> Before adopting a new technology, ask yourself: "Does it solve a specific problem or significantly enhance my product? Is it worth the learning curve and potential instability? Is this going to help us further down the line?"
