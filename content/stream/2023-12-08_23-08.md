> You either build for a device or you build for the web. You can’t build a web-app that’s just for the iMac. If you try, people will access it from other devices and rightfully expect to be able to use it, because that’s what the web is. When we build for the web, our initial design should respond to what we know about our users, and the layout and content should be able to subtly respond to a user’s capabilities on the fly. That’s how we build a more responsive web. Not a mobile web, or a desktop web, or an iPad web, or any other kind of web we might try to predict.

This is a quote from a very old post (2011) that its still relevant today that recently appeared again in my feed. From [New Website](https://arie.ls/2011/new-arie-ls/) by [Ariel Salminen](https://arie.ls/)
