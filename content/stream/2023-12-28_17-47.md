> The Chrome Developer “blog” homepage is a perfect example of the awfulness of modern web dev:
> A page that is updated maybe once a week is dynamically client-side generated
> A page that has almost no interactivity needs 109 requests (mostly JavaScript) to load
> A page with maybe 400 words of text requires 1.3MB plus 10MB for resources

> A 70KB RSS file provides more value and is more readable
> A blog without an RSS feed isn’t a blog. Find another word.
