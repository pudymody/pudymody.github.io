> Then I explained that if you want to make this span _behave_ like a real link, you have to add a `tabindex`, a `role`, CSS to style it, javascript to give it a `:visited` state, much, much, much more javascript to give it a context menu that makes sense (which is impossible to do right, because every browser has a _different_ context menu for a link), and then you’ll have to test if this _“link”_ shows up in the list of links in a screen reader. I don’t think it does. There are so many hidden layers of UX in this simple HTML element. And these layers of UX are the details that matter, of you ask me. These details are why everybody should care about HTML.
