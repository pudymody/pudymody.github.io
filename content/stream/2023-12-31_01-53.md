> To avoid shitty logic, you need to know what's happening in your code. If there's "magic" anywhere in the mix, you have a black box with no obvious cause and effect. This means that what you *think* is happening and what *actually* happens start to diverge.

> Software is built by humans and humans make mistakes. Therefore, software should be everything *but* magic. It shouldn't be overly concise and clever — it should be explicit and predictable. It shouldn't make assumptions — it should throw errors.

> Make the final product magical, not the software that runs it.
