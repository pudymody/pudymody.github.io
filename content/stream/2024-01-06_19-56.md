> I spent almost all of this year working on projects for other people. While I am proud of the work I did, and enjoyed it, there’s still something special about making tools for yourself. Does anyone else in the world want to make their websites in a weird dialect of Lua? Maybe not. But I do, and that’s enough.

> **Try building something for yourself.** Try writing code for you, and you alone. Don’t worry about whether it will look good on your resumé or attract lots of stars on GitHub. Just write something that feels good to you. Explore a weird idea and see where it takes you.

From [I made JSX for Lua (because I hate static sites)](https://bvisness.me/luax/) by [Ben Visness](https://bvisness.me/)

I dont share some of the thoughts, but i always like this thing of *doing something for you because its fun*.
