> When I say “I don’t know where everyone went,” I know everyone’s out there _surfing the web_, of course, but it feels like it’s a different place now. When the algorithms are determining everything we should be seeing, it’s a much less personal internet. The “For You” pages of the world are right, I **am** interested in that content, but I’m not seeing it from my friends, or that one author I like, or that random blog I found when I was learning about an obscure hobby.

From [I miss human curation](https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/human-curation/) by [Cassidy Williams](https://blog.cassidoo.co/)

I also found myself mourning in the last weeks the old communities that i had on the internet.
