> But, *whose user is it anyway?* That's irrelevent. The ultimate goal is to provide a good and accessible experience to the user. The way email clients and senders are handling this right now takes focus away from that goal and the engineering effort is instead put into tricking the other party's code to do what you want.

Its always the same game of mouse and cat around different topics like with ads when the user is not the one in control.
