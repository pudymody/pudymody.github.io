> As a web developer, having a quick [go-to web stack](https://andrewwalpole.com/blog/whats-your-go-to-web-stack-2024-edition/) to build projects like this is essential. So many times I’ve had project ideas of grandeur, only to get stalled immediately in the technical architecture because I didn’t have the right tools on-hand to get started.

> But not this time. My muscle memory for Astro + Vue hosted on github + vercel has become strong enough that these things faded away into the background, letting me focus on the core functionality.

> If you don’t have this at-hand, I recommend going into real prototype mode and using something like [codepen](https://codepen.io).
