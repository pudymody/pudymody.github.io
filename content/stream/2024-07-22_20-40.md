> What makes RSS so powerful is that [it is an open format](http://scripting.com/stories/2009/05/12/whyOpenFormatsAreSoImporta.html). RSS is one of the reasons the blogosphere grew so rapidly and it is the reason why podcasting exploded: because this open format allowed everyone to participate by simply publishing a feed anywhere on the web, without being restricted by platform requirements, closed APIs, and paywalls. And this superpower is also why RSS is having a renaissance today: it allows everyone to subscribe to, share, [syndicate](https://indieweb.org/POSSE), and [cross-post](https://echo.rknight.me) content on the open web.

> RSS already is the cornerstone of many open technology systems like podcasting, which can’t be owned and controlled by any one company. [As Anil Dash notes](https://www.anildash.com/2024/02/06/wherever-you-get-podcasts/), this alone is *radical*, because it is the triumph of exactly the kind of technology that's supposed to be impossible: open and empowering tech that allows people to have ownership over their work and their relationship with their audience.
