> Imagine you post and make new friends on an online network for more than a decade – and suddenly, your account gets suspended for no apparent reason. And there is nothing you can do about it.

> Or imagine the online community you were an active part of for years just closes down and all user data gets deleted after a few months. And there is nothing you can do about it.

> Or imagine that a site you poured all your thoughts and writing into decides overnight that it might be a good idea to sell access to all user data to a company that is training their large language model with it. And again, there is nothing you can do about it.

> Now imagine a place where you actually own your content, your connections, and your online identity.

> And now, imagine that this place is your personal website, under your own domain name, under your control.

> This is the basic idea behind the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/).
