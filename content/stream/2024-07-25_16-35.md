> Right now I’m working on something, a big piece with no clear edge. I don’t really know what it is yet — or where it’s going — but for days I’ll leave it alone and wait for inspiration to strike. I’ll wait for a character’s name or an event to tumble out of the ether or hop right into my lap. I’ll wait for a scene to take shape or a paragraph to be whittled down. But progress has been glacially slow on this project because that’s just not how work works.

> So if design has taught me anything it’s this: Don’t wait. Just keep noodling. Creativity isn’t a thing that you are, or a thing that you will be temporarily in the future. Creativity isn’t luck, either.

> Creativity is simply a byproduct of work.
