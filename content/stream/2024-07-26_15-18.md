> localghost.dev has a new theme! In search of a little project over the merrineum that didn’t require me to learn anything and therefore use my brain, I remembered there was a stylesheet hidden in the themes directory of my website that I hadn’t finished. The theme: teenage personal websites in the early 00s. It was a lot of fun to build, and really nostalgic to recreate the websites of my youth. Think impossibly tiny fonts, blocky layouts with a sidebar full of assorted crap, and grungey photoshop brushes. (But this time with CONTAINER QUERIES.)

> ![A screenshot of my new theme, with a purple background and two boxes - sidebar and content - scrunched up against the left hand side of the page. The font is very small. The header image has assorted grungy patterns on it with a distorted cursive font that says 'localghost'.](https://localghost.dev/img/blog/00s-sites/2003-theme.png)
