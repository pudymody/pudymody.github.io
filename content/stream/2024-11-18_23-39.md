> Am I an analog girly, or am I just a snob?

> Probably both. I feel like the more experienced and “deep” I get into tech, the more I retreat into… low-tech. I enjoy pen and paper. I have fun with [my typewriter](https://cassidoo.co/post/micro-journal/). I want DVDs instead of streaming. I like using a point and shoot camera instead of just my phone’s camera.

> I like not relying on the internet or some level of availability to be entertained or to do tasks. I like owning the things I own, and not thinking about what algorithms are watching me back. I like not being interrupted by notifications when I’m doing something.
