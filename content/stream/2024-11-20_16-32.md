> Good defaults make things easier to teach. They point to what the layout method is designed for. Flexbox is really designed for putting things into a line and distributing spare space. So that initial behaviour of putting all your things in a row is a great starting point for whatever you might want to do. It may be *all* you need to do. It’s not difficult as a teacher to then unpack how to add space inside or outside items, align them, or make it a column rather than a row. Step by step, from the defaults.
