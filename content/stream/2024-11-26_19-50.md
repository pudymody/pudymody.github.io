> Having been in a startup situation where literally *everything* was deleted, you begin to understand that it ain’t all about the code we write. The “outputs”; all the code, the designs, the processes, the tests—they’re ultimately fleeting. It might be our choice, it might not, but it’ll all be replaced or removed in time.

> But the relationships you make, the impact you have in colleagues' & customers' lives, and the growth that occurs in your professional journey outlasts any fork in the road.
