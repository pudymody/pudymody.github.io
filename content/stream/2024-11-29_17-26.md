> Perhaps most well-known today for its jarringly out-of-place [high-octane soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7rlhjazGo) by the inimitable Tim Follin, the game makes you play bizarre minigames to reveal a drawing, and then — in traditional *Pictionary* fashion — you have to guess what was drawn, against the clock.

> A community quickly formed around “CSS crimes”, making all sorts of wonderful things by pushing the platform’s capabilities to the limit. Blackle’s [CSS Puzzle Box](https://cohost.org/blackle/post/260204-div-style-width-60) remains one of the most impressive creations on the site. I took part in this phenomenon too, making a [zoetrope](https://cohost.org/lunasorcery/post/2465593-testing-your-animati) that shows your browser’s refresh rate, a [demoscene-esque twister](https://cohost.org/lunasorcery/post/2442936-cohost-as-a-demoscen), a recreation of the [Star Wars opening sequence](https://cohost.org/lunasorcery/post/2256206-div-id-container), a light [hypnotic induction](https://cohost.org/lunasorcery/post/4325452-cw-hypnosis-hypnok) replicating the site’s UI, and [more](https://cohost.org/lunasorcery/tagged/css%20crimes).

> With the easter egg drawings starting to show up, people naturally started enquiring about the possibility of submitting their own

> I’ve given a lot of thought to why the Pictionary bot in particular was so popular, and I think it ultimately comes down to the “yes, and” posting culture of Cohost. This could have just been a bot posting drawings from the original NES game. But people latched onto it and made their own game out of it. People loved it so much they wanted to contribute back to it, for no other reward than getting to share their work with their friends. People formed a community around it, and I’m so grateful that they did.

I cant get over the main theme of the game, but a beautiful tale of how internet could still be a nice and beautiful place to share and hangout with others
