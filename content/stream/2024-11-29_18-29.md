> We’ve built incredible general-purpose computing devices with processing power to run circles around the big desktops I learned to program on. But the way we interface with them locks them up as devices for consumption, not creation.

> It’s **not** because I can’t use my phone for these—I have! People usually like to bash iOS, saying things like, “it’s just not possible to write the apps to do all this in the first place…” but for me, all the apps actually exist! I drafted this whole post in [a markdown app](http://1writerapp.com) on my phone. [Blink Shell](https://blink.sh) gives me a whole Linux environment to build code, even on iOS. [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) lets me build a website at home and access it anywhere. GitHub, Gmail, and Google Docs all have mobile apps.

> Rather, the reason I don’t is because it’s **so unsatisfying**. The disconnect between my speed of thought and my speed of action is grating, making it impossible to get into anything resembling a flow state. Like a runner stuck on a crowded sidewalk, I’m constantly frustrated by the sputtering pace of progress.
