> I don’t necessarily believe that everyone can have a job or even a career that makes them spring out of bed in the morning and gives them creative satisfaction in their day-to-day. Ultimately we live under late-stage capitalism, and I certainly couldn’t afford my house (or indeed any house) if I dedicated my life to, say, running choirs.

> So I get my creative energy and joy from elsewhere. I’m fiercely protective of my free time, even if it’s just spent horizontal on the sofa playing video games. When the working day is done, I have creative pursuits that bring me joy and put art into the world in their own little way.

> Art is in the weird and wonderful websites I make occasionally, which bring people (including myself!) a moment of joy when they land on them.

> In a world of shit, creativity for creativity’s sake is radical.

**I cant stress enough that last quote**, So i will quote it again

> In a world of shit, creativity for creativity’s sake is radical.
