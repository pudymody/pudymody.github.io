> The year is 2005. You're blasting a pirated mp3 of "Feel Good Inc" and chugging vanilla coke while updating your website.

> It’s just a simple change, so you log on via FTP, edit your `style.css` file, hit save - and reload the page to see your changes live.

> Now listen, I really don’t want to go back to doing live updates in production. That can get painful real fast. But I think it’s amazing when the files you see in your code editor are exactly the same files that are delivered to the browser. No compilation, no node process, no build step. Just edit, save, boom.

> Funnily enough, many build tools advertise their superior “Developer Experience” (DX). For my money, there’s no better DX than shipping code straight to the browser and not having to worry about some cryptic `node_modules` error in between.

> So, can we all ditch our build tools soon? Probably not.
