> "Good things happen when I try hard to chase my sense of excitement, ignoring impulses to produce legible outcomes." I think that observation about *legibility* really reached me. I went through a period in the past where I found I was only reading books that I felt like I *ought* to be reading and had ultimately been killing my enjoyment of reading, and I was trying to recover that feeling about programming.

> Also, had I known I would need to implement some of MMX, would I have even started this project? Not even sure. I have seen it observed that sometimes not knowing how hard something will be is an important help to actually just starting to try.

> I have sometimes thought about this: what are the chances of someone having both the low-level skill set needed to usefully contribute, and also the need to emulate an old Windows program? This is to me one of the best things about the internet, where even if such a person is a one in a billion chance, we have a few billion people around on here.
