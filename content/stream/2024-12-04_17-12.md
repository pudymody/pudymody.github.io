> Communities function like that Tamagotchi. You can’t play with them until you feed them and care for them. Unless you keep those health and happiness meters high, they will not behave in the ways you’d like them to, potentially undermining your efforts and investments.

> This goes for any community. Whether it is one you created and managed for your product or open source project or one that previously existed (though especially the latter).

> One of the fun aspects of the Tamagotchi was that it could be unpredictable. They had personalities and they evolved in stages, which also affected their behavior. You had to invest time and effort to care for the Tamagotchi, but the outcome was unpredictable because the personality was intrinsic to the specific Tamagotchi and not something you could control.

> In much the same way communities tend to have a personality. Existing communities will have already established one that you need to invest time to understand and adapt to.

> Instead of tracking the outputs, track the inputs. What are the activities we did to foster the community this month?

> Done right, community efforts can pay off immensely
