> There is a cognitive bias known as *the curse of knowledge*, which occurs when one assumes that others possess the same level of knowledge during communication.

> This phenomenon is quite common in software development. People who have experience writing certain types of code and those who don't often struggle to communicate effectively, even if they share the same theoretical foundation (algorithms, programming languages, or domain knowledge). The reason for this lies in the significant flexibility of software engineering; there are multiple ways to implement the same functionality, each with its own set of challenges.

> To eliminate such communication barriers, various technical fields have developed their own set of idioms or design patterns. New projects built on these practices can avoid a lot of unnecessary trouble. The same is true for the field of databases; however, due to its niche nature and high degree of commercialization, knowledge circulated among the public is very scarce, and engineering practices are scattered across various open-source projects.

> In this article, I will build a SQL IR from scratch based on my own best practices, which will facilitate the progressive sharing of some design considerations.
