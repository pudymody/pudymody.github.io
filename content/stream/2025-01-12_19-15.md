> As I weave through double parked cars and brave pedestrians, I see that this bicycle with an electric motor has returned the hope I’d lost over the years. Here, listen, it whispers: tech doesn’t have to be a con or make us the worst versions of ourselves. Look: technology has kept its promise and genuinely made the world better!

> My e-bike is pulling me into an alternate dimension where tech isn’t designed to be a grift from the start, as these two-wheeled bad boys aren’t only here to generate shareholder value; they’re designed to help.

> I’m halfway through my ride now and it’s dawning on me that this little e-bike of mine offers a critique against tech culture as a mere profit-generating tool, sure.

> Here’s the kicker though. E-bikes aren’t cool because of the way they look or how loud they are and they’re certainly not cool because they turn heads or make strangers jealous. Instead, e-bikes don’t care about cool. They argue for a new kind of world where technology is genuinely helpful, where technology doesn’t have to be cool at all.

> Technology can just do the job it’s meant to.

> As someone who’s worked in tech for more than a decade (sorry) I’ve seen how a lot of folks in the industry are terrified of making something merely useful. It must be important! It must scale! It must have a million eyes on it!
