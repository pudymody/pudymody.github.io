> Hello! I was talking to a friend about how git works today, and we got onto the topic – where does git store your files? We know that it’s in your `.git` directory, but where exactly in there are all the versions of your old files?

From [In a git repository, where do your files live?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/09/14/in-a-git-repository--where-do-your-files-live-/)

Im a lover for this kind of deep dive/look into internals and Julia always writes them in a nice exploratory way.
