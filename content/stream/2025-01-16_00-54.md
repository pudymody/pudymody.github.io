> Hello! The other day, I started wondering – has anyone ever made a FUSE filesystem for a git repository where all every commit is a folder? It turns out the answer is yes! There’s [giblefs](https://github.com/fanzeyi/giblefs), [GitMounter](https://belkadan.com/blog/2023/11/GitMounter/), and [git9](https://orib.dev/git9.html) for Plan 9.

> But FUSE is pretty annoying to use on Mac – you need to install a kernel extension, and Mac OS seems to be making it harder and harder to install kernel extensions for security reasons. Also I had a few ideas for how to organize the filesystem differently than those projects.

> So I thought it would be fun to experiment with ways to mount filesystems on Mac OS other than FUSE, so I built a project that does that called [git-commit-folders](https://github.com/jvns/git-commit-folders).
