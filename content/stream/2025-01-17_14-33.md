> There’s a wonderful article by Sebastian Bensusan: “[We need visual programming. No, not like that.](https://blog.sbensu.com/posts/demand-for-visual-programming/)” (the dot is part of the title ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯).

> In it, Sebastian argues that we shouldn’t try to replace all code with visual programming but instead only add graphics where it makes sense:

> > Most visual programming environments fail to get any usage. Why? They try to replace code syntax and business logic but developers never try to visualize that. Instead, developers visualize state transitions, memory layouts, or network requests.
> > In my opinion, those working on visual programming would be more likely to succeed if they started with aspects of software that developers already visualize.
