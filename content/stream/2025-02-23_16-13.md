> If you take just one thing away from this article, I want it to be this: please build your own website. A little home on the independent web.

> It feels like we've lost this decades-old art form; the individuality of design and the uniqueness of content you used to see on these webpages. The notion of experimenting with HTML and CSS without worrying about something looking weird or out of place. The beauty of a website built by a person, *because they wanted to*.

> So, once again my digital call to arms: build your own website. Make it fun. Make it pointless. But most importantly: make it yours.

Damn i could almost quote the entire article. A must read on this times.
