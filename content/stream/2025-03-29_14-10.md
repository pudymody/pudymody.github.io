> **Discord is where the open web goes to die.** Why do so many tech projects insist on hiding knowledge inside a walled garden? Discord is private by design.

> To illustrate my annoyance, I was searching the web for an ArkType question and found a [partial discussion](https://www.answeroverflow.com/m/1332421231475163206) on what appears to be either:

> 1.  a Discord scraping content farm
> 2.  an attempt at providing a solution to the Discord problem

> Either way, there is clearly knowledge lost to the web inside the ArkType Discord. I don’t mean to pick on ArkType here, it just happens to be my most recent example.

> Open source projects are not required to provide “tech support”. Most rely on their users helping one another, sharing knowledge to common problems. Surely it’s best for the project to keep that discussion on the _open_ web?
