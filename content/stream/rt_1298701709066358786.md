"There's more than meets the eye"

A good gentle reminder from ⁦@vanschneider⁩ to take it easy on yourself, don't believe everything you see, and always remember that you only see what they want you to see. Social media is full of curated illusions. [https://vanschneider.com/theres-more-than-meets-the-eye](https://vanschneider.com/theres-more-than-meets-the-eye)
