@jaffathecake @DKundel @chaos_monster @DasSurma @bendhalpern @forem My take has been (and still is) that you should send HTML wherever you can, and use JS to augment. It renders faster, and it's resilient to JS failures.

It is a shame that as a community we've made it harder for people to do that by default.
