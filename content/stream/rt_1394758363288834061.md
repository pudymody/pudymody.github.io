I have been continuously disappointed by the usability of gnu docs, so I've done some hacking and made single page (searchable!!) html builds of some info(1) pages, fixed the css, and posted them on my Web site

Sample:
[https://docs.jade.fyi/gnu/ld.html](https://docs.jade.fyi/gnu/ld.html)
All of them:
[https://docs.jade.fyi/gnu/](https://docs.jade.fyi/gnu/)
