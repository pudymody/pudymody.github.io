Not only did this guy steal $2.7m but even *after* he ran off with the money people are *still trading the NFTs* each of which pays the guy who stole the money a 4% royalty every time. They are paying their scammer even after he completed the scam! [https://twitter.com/vice/status/1445443679703879687](https://twitter.com/vice/status/1445443679703879687)
