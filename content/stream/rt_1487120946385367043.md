ðŸ§µ Web platform tests are a really handy way to find out about browser support when other sources don't have the data.

I wanted to know if I could create a Worker within a Worker.

[https://caniuse.com/webworkers](https://caniuse.com/webworkers) - no data
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker#browser_compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker#browser_compatibility) - no data

WPT to the rescueâ€¦
