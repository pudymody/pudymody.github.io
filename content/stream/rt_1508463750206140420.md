My brother lived in Hawaii when this happened. His neighbor got into a bathtub with a mattress over his head, took a shot of whiskey, and texted his ex girlfriend that he still loved her in case they all died. False alarm on the nuke but they got back together! Love that story [https://twitter.com/ampol_moment/status/1507836933787037701](https://twitter.com/ampol_moment/status/1507836933787037701)
