I challenged myself back in 2018 to make every single Pok√©mon Quest icon with CSS only on @CodePen. I finally finished in 2022! Each icon is fully responsive and there's even a CSS-only navigation to sort by type. Check it out at [https://codepen.io/gabriellewee/pen/KKQwydY](https://codepen.io/gabriellewee/pen/KKQwydY)
