NASA only uses 15 digits of Ï€ for calculating interplanetary travel. At 40 digits, you could calculate the circumference of a circle the size of the visible universe with an accuracy that'd fall off by less than the diameter of a single hydrogen atom [http://ow.ly/rhmO30o4k7G](http://ow.ly/rhmO30o4k7G)
